  ((Roses flower in the vale;
  there we hear the northern tale…))

  (Once a beauty has gone rogue;
  turned a troll by the rot;
  made a mirror to mock God.
  What a mischief indeed,
  the trickster is pleased.
  And Kai…)

  And I…
  Someone’s cry.
  The icey shard
  is in my heart.
  I can hear it whispering
  while my mind is simmering.

  It’s all these irritants,
  especially the flowers.
  So annoying.
  But how perfect are fractals:
  the intricate edges
  of tiny snowflakes;
  magnifying glass reveals
  self-repetitive patterns…
  How pretty.

  I remember there was
  something else
  or someone;
  not sure about names,
  can’t see a face.
  Sometimes old titles
  pop-up in my mind:
  “Hitchhiker’s guide…”.
  Yes, let’s hitchhike a ride,
  maybe I’ll learn something.

  What’s this? A kiss?
  I feel nothing…

  Clouds are gathering
  or is it a swarm of snow-bees?
  Their monarch seems to be
  kind to me…

  And here’s this puzzle.
  I’m not looking forward to the prize,
  I’m only curious as to the answer:
  it helps to be preoccupied.
  
  I think they’re cheating:
  too many pieces are missing
  to form a legible anything,
  let alone the word I am…

  Oh, not this again!
  Has no one heard
  of asking first?
  I don’t like it: it’s too wet.
  Ah, it’s your tears…
  I meant…
  I think I know You.
  Now look what you’ve done:
  I’m crying, too.
