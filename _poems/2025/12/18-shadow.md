  My dear, oh so dear friend,
  I'm ill, oh so very ill.
  This pain
  Comes again,
  A screaming void,
  An emptier,
  A howling wind
  In a desolate field.
  Or is it my inner Dreamer
  Deprived of sleep and senses
  Rebels on me:
  Sheds away my brain cells
  Like autumn leaves?

  My ears wobble
  On my noddle.
  My head
  Can't stand
  Standing on my neck,
  Tries to take
  A flight.
  Meanwhile,
  A dark, oh so dark shadow,
  A shade, oh so shady shadow,
  On my bed she sits,
  Doesn't let me sleep.
  Her finger traces lines,
  Scrolling the scroll,
  While she whispers to me
  Like a priest to a corpse,
  Reading me… life…
  Of some psycho and drunk
  Filling me with
  Aversion and murk.
  «Listen.
  Listen.»
  The Shadow's hissing,
  The scroll’s unraveling,
  The finger's slithering -
  «To these thoughts and ideas,
  awesome project proposals.
  This society of patterns -
  she prefers "petals"
  (of madness) -
  she still exists
  in this forsaken place
  run by merciless crooks,
  and shameless cynics,
  amidst
  the self-fulfilling prophecies and lies,
  grey skies,
  and endless cowardice.
  Once upon a time
  when snow shined
  like Devil's silver
  and snowflakes danced
  in starry lights
  she fancied herself a hero,
  a proud apostate,
  and maybe a trickster,
  preferring mischief
  to their lies.
  Thought herself gracious,
  a voice of mercy
  with a duty to lit the lights,
  and maybe a poet
  with imagination that ran so wild.
  She called this man
  she hardly knew
  “her beloved Baby Blue".
  She said "Happiness,
  it just so happens,
  belongs to liars
  who tarnish the Golden Rule,
  as for the rest -
  it's gloom
  and pity at best,
  and maybe charity sex".
  She used to say
  "Do what you must and come what may".
  She used to claim
  that when you lose
  and people all around you
  are so stupid, obnoxious or daft
  that you feel that you've had quite enough,
  you're supposed to chin-up
  and smile,
  if only to defy,
  to stick it up to someone,
  to learn from your mistakes,
  to be less wrong the next time.»

  Hey you, missy,
  Who the fuck cares?
  Mind your own business,
  You dirty nightmare!
  Stop peeking at mine.
  One of these days
  I'll forget to be kind.
  What's it to me,
  Her stupid life?
  Go shove your scroll
  Where no sun shines.

  And the Shadow stares straight,
  Deep into my eyes,
  As if she knows
  That on the inside
  I'm an impostor and a beast
  Like all these
  Crooks and thieves.
  And the only difference is
  That this
  Child of darkness
  Is still fooling herself
  Into aspiring to believe.

  ...

  My dear, oh so dear friend,
  I'm ill, oh so very ill.
  This pain
  Comes again,
  A screaming void,
  An emptier
  In a desolate field.
  Or is it my inner Dreamer
  Deprived of sleep
  Rebels on me:
  Sheds away my senses
  Like autumn leaves,
  Pretends to be wise,
  Sings to me?

  Silent night, lonely night
  All is calm, all is bright.
  In the distance, outside,
  A wildcat growls,
  Or is it an owl?
  The wind
     begins
        to howl.
  All the wooden horses,
  All the wooden men
  Are moving in closer
  Completing the encirclement.
  Shiny white flakes
  Coat
  Their branches, the fields.
  And I await no one
  Neither friend nor enemy.
  Only my Shadow
  Won't
     leave
        me…

  This dark, or so dark Shadow,
  This Shade, or so shady Shadow,
  The guest so well-known
  So unwelcomed,
  Scrolling the scroll,
  Can’t leave me alone.
  «Come on now, darling»
  The Shadow's muttering,
  Leaning in closer,
  Almost touching.
  «I don't think I've seen
  any of the obscene
  so needlessly suffering.
  Why aren't you sleeping?
  Ah! Let's blame the scene:
  the half-born Moon!
  Haven't you been?
  Right... On these noons
  you’re so clean,
  barely human,
  never playing,
  always preaching,
  almost pontificating.
  What?
  Still cannot think
  of anyone or anything
  but that mere figment
  of your "powerful imagination"?
  How about a revelation:
  you are too old
  for imaginary friends
  with hearts of gold.
  What?
  Can no longer separate
  reality from dreams,
  my dear Alice
  from Underworld?
  Here's a well-meaning advice:
  do as all do,
  drink, buy, socialize.
  Talk to real people,
  like your nephew or niece.
  I can make them call you,
  whenever I please.
  Or better yet,
  find a bedwarmer,
  there’re apps for that.
  When will you finally see,
  that you're like all the rest
  with you scroll, your sins, and your dreams?
  What?
  Still thinking yourself a poet,
  but lacking talent, readers, and grammar?
  What?
  Still pining over the “sexy sexagenarian”?
  What's your new nickname for him?
  "Your future anything"?
  Don't you know, my little wimp,
  that you never can win.
  C'mon, it's not even funny.
  Remember the litany:
  "What is true is already so.
  Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.
  Hiding doesn't make it go away.
  And because it is true, it's what's there anyway.
  What's untrue isn't there to be lived.
  No matter how much you want to believe.
  And you can stand the truth,
  for you're already enduring it."»

  The truth is at least two-edged sword,
  Think long and hard on your next words!
  I'm still the Master of this world,
  Can conjure up whatever I want.
  Like, say,
  The mighty Vorpal blade
  From that Underworld.
  Choose: your arm or your neck?
  (The inquisitor's only staring back.)
  The Vorpal blade goes snicker-snack!
  Cutting off the bloodless hand.
  The Shadow drops the scroll, and
  As it falls
  It dissolves
  Into shiny white flakes
  Flying away
  With the wind
  To cover the field.

  ...

  My dear, oh so dear friend,
  I'm ill, oh so very ill.
  This pain
  Comes again,
  An emptier
  In desolation.
  Or is it my inner Dreamer
  Rebels on me:
  Sheds away my doubts
  Like autumn leaves,
  No longer dreams,
  Dares to be?

  «There she sits
  on her linens.
  In appearance
  how like a woman,
  a paragon of all creatures.
  Still breathing.
  Still pondering her questions.
  Still *not* giving-up.
  Not giving-in.
  Alone with me.»
