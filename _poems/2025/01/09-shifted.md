   Despite my self-hatred,
   I used to be so calm and centered.
   But since the center shifted,
   I've been oscillating, untethered,
   A ship adrift without an anchor.
   But the amplitude - it should be decreasing.
   I hope... It must be.
   I'll be fine.
   It just takes time
   For everything to re-adjust.
   I must re-balance;
   In this unbalanced state,
   I tend to make mistakes.
   And there's also this urge to act,
   But no direction,
   Like an energy build-up.

   Apparently, I defy the second law of thermodynamics: it's not diminishing one bit, still changing in the wrong direction.
