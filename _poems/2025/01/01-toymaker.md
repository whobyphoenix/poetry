poem_title: "Let's play."
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision
text: |
   "I toyed with supernovas,
   Turned galaxies into spinning tops,
   Gambled with God
   And made him a jack-in-the-box."
   Yet, the galaxies are still spinning
   And every box is revealing
   The one
   Who has won,
   Toymaker, you silly.
commentary: |
   He made a jigsaw out of my story.
