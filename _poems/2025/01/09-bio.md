text: |
   An estranged acolyte,
   Holding a candle in sunlight,
   Inexperienced and terrified,
   With a big head
   Full of many cheerful facts
   About a square of hypotenuse,
   And how to tighten a noose,
   And others of similar importance,
   With a tendency to introspect,
   Especially upon losing one's self-respect,
   And to over-do everything
   Especially the introspecting.
   Feel free to calumniate
   Every single trait,
   But never culminate with idolater.
