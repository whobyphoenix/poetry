poem_title: "Never against dreams."
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision
text: |
   - When darkness comes, you face it,
   as hero should and does,
   with certain heart and sway not.
   - I'll try my best to do
   what's right, and listen to
   the books where senses dwell,
   and always keep my guard on
   against what preys upon... my dreams.
