poem_title: "Improving upon Blake."
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision
text: |
   Those who restrain Desire,
   Do so because
   Theirs is weak enough for taming;
   And Reason,
   The restrainer,
   Usurps
   Desire's place
   And governs the unwilling.
   And thus restrained in chains,
   They by degrees become unliving,
   Till none of life remains
   But only shadows of their former being.
commentary: |
   "Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity. Dip him in the river who loves water. The nakedness of woman is the work of God. Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires."
