poem_title: "And now the lions, wolves, dragons, and eagles - all shall cease."
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision
text: |
   - Mars is bright these nights.
   Oh, so unusually bright...
   What do the trees hide?
   - A soothsaying, my sire:
   The collapse of your empire...
commentary: |
   With thunder and fire,
   leading his starry hosts
   through the waste wilderness,
   the King promulgates
   his ten commandments,
   glancing his beamy eyelids
   over the deep in dark dismay.
   Where the Son of Fire stamps
   the stony law to dust,
   loosing the eternal horses from the dens of night,
   crying: “Empire is no more!”
