   By now I know
   It will go on
   No matter what.
   Only I want,
   I so do want
   To be with you.
   And even more -
   To be yours.
   Forever and ever yours only.
   This bit is somehow so exciting,
   My future anything.
   And for everyone to envy you...
   And to call you a lucky bastard or something...

   You poor man... Got yourself into this much trouble...
