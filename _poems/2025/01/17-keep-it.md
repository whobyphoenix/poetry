   Keep your wondering eyes,
   Keep your sensitive heart.
   Not so many posses
   The piercing-through art.
   Though treasures are hidden
   Behind walls of night,
   Your gift of perception
   Is perfectly right.
   Take comfort in knowing
   You are not alone -
   Some hearts are just wired
   To see what's unknown.
