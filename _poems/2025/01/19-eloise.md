   Meanwhile,
   In Eloise's mind:
   "C'mon... Seriously?!
   How much more obvious a woman must be?
   Call me old-fashioned,
   But I thought this kind of confession
   Needs to be somewhat more special
   Than an entry
   In a not-so-secret diary...
   In hindsight,
   Praises of your excellence
   Could've been more precise..."
