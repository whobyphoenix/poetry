   Hey you, up in the sky,
   С днём рождения!
   Порой мне кажется, что я
   Понимаю тебя,
   How my pain is but a dim reflection,
   Too-few-dimensional projection:
   The immensity of your love is
   *Always* unreciprocated.
   So, how about today,
   For your birthday,
   I admit that I love you, too -
   immensely? Well, not all of you,
   Just that one bit, the spark,
   The speck, the shard,
   The shimmering light
   In my beloved's heart.
   Is this enough?
   The one who hosts it
   Is so immensely loved.
