poem_title: "Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!"
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision
text: |
   Down with the bloody Red Queen!
   Rise up, gallymoggers, and sing.
   Light up every fire
   With burning desire
   To strive for the better, and dream
   Of the world where all can free,
   Exactly the way it should be,
   Where injustice and wars are no more,
   And then make it be our world.
