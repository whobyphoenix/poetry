   My particular Archangel,
   Let's re-do the book to our pleasure,
   To its infernal or free-form edition,
   (Wouldn't be too far from the original...)
   Which the world shall have
   Only if they behave.
   Or better yet, at our discretion,
   Whether they will or no,
   After all, one Law
   For the lion and ox
   Is oppression.
