   It is like living with a White Hole in your chest.
   And it's almost unbearable.
   There are downsides to being singularly focused.
   There needs to be another characteristic for one's system of values
   apart from tiers and established priorities:
   distances. A metric for gaps between tiers.
   Because this is what's so unusual lately and what keeps changing:
   the distance between the top tiers and the rest is increasing.
   I've been reshaping myself my whole life
   and it made me stay
   like an unfired clay,
   a soft metal,
   a moldable material.
   All these major shifts have momentum -
   still can't find my footing.
   Nothing feels right.
   Lower tiers are almost out of sight.
commentary: |
   Things with me do have momentum, inertia, take a long time. I choose to think that it's 'cause I'm not shallow, alright?
