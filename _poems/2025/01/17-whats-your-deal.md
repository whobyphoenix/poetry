poem_title: "Seriously, what's your deal?"
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision
text: |
   Your voice never fails to compel,
   Your smile's like a star-blessing spell.
   You find wonder rare
   In things not to share,
   The one who makes darkness dispel.
commentary: |
   Or, alternatively, it's all due to:
   1. that love potion you took from the Pentagon's secret laboratories; or
   2. that heretical recipes of persecuted alchemists from the underground libraries of the Vatican, which you "borrowed" while the Pope was occupied; or
   3. that ancient family secret passed down from generation to generation; or
   4. that blessing you received from his holiness the Dalai Lama in gratitude for your kindness; or   
   5. that magical artifact you discovered in Native American burial grounds and never returned to its rightful owners; or
   6. aliens.
   Actually, it's all your "puppy eyes" and the "damsel in distress" vibe - the rest of it all, too, but these are the "secret ingriedient": hit my "sweet spot" on so many levels... How dare you?
