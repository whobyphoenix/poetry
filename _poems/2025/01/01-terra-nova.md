   Do you really love me this much
   To put up with all this?
   I don't think anyone ever did,
   That's why it's so hard to believe.
   Or maybe they did
   And I completely ignored it?
   No, I don't think so,
   This is truly unique.
   I'd be a fool to spoil it.
   So?.. The right approach is what?
   To freeze and not even breathe?
   This is Terra Nova for me...
