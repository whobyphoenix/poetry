   It took me quite a leap of faith
   To believe in you,
   That you're for real,
   And just as amazing as I think of you.
   I'm still falling of that cliff.
   And if you are like this
   Then you can handle
   The maxed out weirdness,
   Built-in unevenness,
   Necessity of mutual forgiveness.
   It's funny how
   I can't find answers to the "why?",
   Whatever is the case.
   Not on my own anyway.

   How is it I'm still on this cliffhanger? It's been this theatrical pause for how many months? The suspense is killing me, quite literally, mr. Overblown-Reputation-for-Clarity.
