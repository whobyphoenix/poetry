   A melody... Ever so brief...
   I'll pretend you're the one who's playing...
   Nowadays I'm so good at make-belief
   and pretending.
   Let's watch Classic Doctor Who together?
   This episode is a bit like "The Story of Isaac".
   By the way, I pretend, it's your favorite Cohen's song.
   I wonder, which one is it really?.. If any...
   Yeah... "Doctor Who" with brownies...
   A pain-numbing remedy,
   a happiness subsidy...
   The Doctor's so young in this episode:
   a pretentious Lord,
   unable to rebel -
   not enough fire -
   somewhat short on compassion,
   outwitting himself...
   His human companion is wiser,
   than the Doctor,
   with his smoke of words suffocating the flame.
   An "old rogue"...
   As if! Not yet, but he will learn.
   How many more lives will it take him?
   about ten?
   to know that his gods
   must be challenged, too.
   For gods pretend to be absolute
   and therefore in this world of no absolute rules
   has no place to dictate our choices.
   Except for the rule of one's conscience.
   no one's to rule.
   Every dictatorship must be abolished.
