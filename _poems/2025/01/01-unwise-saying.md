   They say,
   The way
   You meet the New Year
   Is how you are to spend it.
   Apparently, I'll walk alone the empty streets.
   I wonder what it means...
   Enjoying personal audience
   With you, my dear Universe,
   Amidst these mysterious flocks
   Of white birds
   Spooked by fireworks
   In dark blue skies?..
   Perhaps the saying is not so wise.
commentary: |
   Perhaps it is.
