poem_title: "Wisdom of those dwelling in a void boundless as a nether sky."
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision
text: |
   No bird soars too high
   When on her own wings.
   One thought fills immensity.
   What is now proved
   Was once imagined and not believed.
   You never know what is "enough"
   Unless "too much" you have unsealed.
commentary: |
   "Eternity is in love with children of time."
