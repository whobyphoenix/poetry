poem_title: "To the mighty Dark Lord folded in black clouds hovering next to a flat-sided steep that frowns over the present world."
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision

   Yes, every bird
   That cuts the airy way
   *Is* its own world.
   Every mind in this is the same.
   Only why assume immense delight?
   It just as easy may be a world of pain
   Or blazing light.

   If by the bird you mean a mind
   Soaring free and high
   In the Unknown,
   Then the world of its delight
   Is never closed.
   At least not by the senses
   But perhaps
   By the boundaries
   Of our intelligence,
   Of our capacity for understanding.

   And if what braves the airy ways
   Is a metaphor for happiness
   Then once again,
   The world of immense delight
   Is neither open nor closed:
   Seemingly so remote
   It's but the blink of an eye away,
   Right here for the taking
   Just never a sure thing;
   Thus, to reach
   One needs courage.

   Q: “How do you know but every bird
   that cuts the airy way
   Is an immense world of delight,
   closed by your senses five?”
