poem_title: "f(f) = f"
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision
text: |
   Is ouroboros
   A phoenix's projection
   To time dimension?

   The bird of the sun:
   The One, who proceeds
   From the clash of opposites -
   Thus all become One.
commentary: |
   If you keep striving for the same goal, like becoming Gold, in each recurrence, then a feedback loop becomes a positive feedback loop, and we all know what this means; "the riddle of the living" is so easily solved, like it's no riddle at all, "and if you have not All, All is Nothing" as the inscription goes.
