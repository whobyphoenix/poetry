   "So strange for the stranger 
   To wear shades indoors.
   To wear your smile
   Is doubly so,"
   Must've been my thoughts.
   Actually, no.
   Wasn't thinking at all.
   Was like an automaton
   With the singular goal to keep going.
   Keep it together, do not break apart.
   It was the matter of pride,
   Self respect, and survival.
   Wasn't enough processing power left in my mind to process wonders.
   You must've mistaken it for negligence.
   I honestly don't see
   How I could've reacted differently
   Given the circumstances.
   Only if I was a different person.
   Someone more normal perhaps,
   Who could cry or show weakness,
   Or ask for help from strangers.
   I'm not cut this way,
   I'm truly sorry, babe.
commentary: |
   No point re-hashing. What's done is done. Let's learn lessons and be better, don't skip formalities next time. Or do, but then all the way: start with a kiss, a hug, a grab of hand - something like that. But better yet, be very old-fashioned and bring flowers. And in case you're wondering I did need a hug that day. I needed it badly.
