poem_title: "Conversing with my inner Whateveritis."
authors: phoenix
books: tunnel-vision

   Too often it feels
   Like you can't forgive me for something...
   For existing?
   Or yourself... For the same thing?
   That pastor got it right, don't you think?
   How at least sometimes love is above justice
   Making space for forgiveness.
   Why can't you follow a clear guidance,
   You bundle of potential joy,
   Ever-strangeness,
   And over-abundance?..
