   My favorite bird is back:
   Welcome, honey.
   I thought that it was dead
   But no, still flying.
   Not very hungry, hey,
   You little stray?
   Just peeked at my offerings
   And flew away.
   A wild creature,
   Undomesticated,
   Simply too cute to stay.
   So, how about
   We both figure out
   What to do with such strays?
   Perhaps, the little bandit
   Purring on my bed
   Is an inspiring showcase?
