   Maybe it's time to self-admit
   that I've changed things somewhat.
   I like being the Light's favorite mirror
   regardless of how painful and humiliating it is.
   I'm the worst kind of personality for this:
   blindly playing a part in his ineffable plan.
   Maybe it only works
   exactly because
   this makes my choices truly mine.
   No guidance.
   No support.
   Not even a reward.
   My will in the right place at the right time,
   defined by nothing else but qualities of my mind.
   It is a funny relationship.
   Not a patronage, not an abuse.
   Definitely not a quid-pro-quo.
   I sense we're in store for more.
   Is this how I'm perceived?
   The Light's odd shadow?
