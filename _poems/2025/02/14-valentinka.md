   I love the shimmering lights
   In the abyss of your eyes,
   You walking talking Starlight...
commentary: |
   And in case you prefer funny ones:

   "His eyes are as black as a crow,
   His hair's a color of snow.
   I wish he was mine,
   He's really divine,
   The hero who conquered my sorrow."
