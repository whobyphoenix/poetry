authors: phoenix

   Your inner walls and blockades
   don't work even on minors.
   Let alone on obsessive-compulsive seekers,
   who peeked over too many horizons.
   You know how one such entity
   can cause instability.
   Imagine two or more
   driven toward the same goal.
   It's strange why people would fall
   for the lie that they're incapable,
   that one person's will is for naught,
   when every page in history books shows
   that it's exactly what
   always happens:
   humanity is steered by individuals;
   the grey mass of mundane NPCs
   is not even a counterbalance -
   they simply follow in herds,
   they follow us.
