   How many entities
   With a pretense at greatness
   Must I've offended with my insolence
   To get this unlucky?
   (Lorenzo Valla is strong with me...)
   Like, what did I ever do to Chronos
   To make him so grumpy?
   What was it with Zeus?
   He made him jealous
   With his mere existence?
   What an impudence!
   And the pompous old fool
   Decided to blow out the spark -
   Gulped down the stone
   Instead of conceding his throne
   To the fiery upstart.
   Things didn't end well for the usurper,
   Did they, as it turned out?..
