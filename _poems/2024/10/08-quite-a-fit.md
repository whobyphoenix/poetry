   Quite a fit.
   An ultimate accomplishment:
   Dissolving my pride
   The thing that glued it all together,
   My act of defiance
   In the face of "I'm never
   Good enough".
   You made me doubt the word "never"
   And when it snapped back in place
   There was nothing to keep the balance.
   I'm still too stubborn
   To just drown.
   Only was it that hard
   To show a little respect,
   To be direct?
   Now pain is associated
   With top items
   On my list of remedies
   That I've spent decades collecting.
   It's almost interesting
   How it's still not enough to break me.
   I should start a club
   With a funny name like
   "Cohen's garbage bags".
   Perhaps I could take pride
   In that it's all self-inflicted.
   My mind desperately tries
   To find lessons,
   To draw conclusions.
   The best one so far is
   "Hope is dangerous"
   And "Never again fall in love."
   If you're born of darkness
   Surrounded by it,
   Then the only thing to rely on
   Is the endurance within.
   And when there's nothing but pain
   Then that's it,
   That's what should become the source of it.
   It's even a good thing that the pain is endless,
   As sources of strength go
   This is quite advantageous.
   I'm starting to see humor in the situation.
