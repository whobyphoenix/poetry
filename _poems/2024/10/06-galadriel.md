poem_title: "Finarfin's daughter."
authors: phoenix
books: unsinkable
text: |
   Not one but two
   Great powers it took
   To heal her wounds
   When his dark crown
   Almost
      cut her heart out.
   And as to the fall -
   The light is always falling,
   As mist covers the jewels of Calacirya
   Forever stolen.
