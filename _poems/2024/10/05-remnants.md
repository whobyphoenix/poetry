poem_title: "The remnants of the evening."
authors: phoenix
books: unsinkable

   When streetlights
   Become snowflakes,
   And not so ancient trees
   Pretend to be wise
   Whispering secrets and lies,
   Secretly cursing perhaps
   Me and my silent steps;
   When the wind
      is a breath of mystery
   Dispersing light
   With a dance of leaves,
   Dying
      as all things
   While I'm dispersing
   Disbelief.
