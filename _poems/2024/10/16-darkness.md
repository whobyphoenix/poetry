poem_title: "Darkness."
authors: phoenix
books: unsinkable
text: |
   Negation of light,
   Obstruction of mind,
   An echoing void.
   Not known to life,
   Avoided by death,
   Always astray.
   You know the gate.
   You are the gate,
   The guardian and the key.
   You open the way
   To nothingness above,
   To no company but shadows.
commentary: |
   "Non est salvatori salvator,
   neque defensori dominus,
   nec pater nec mater,
   nihil supernum." -
   Godric Gryffindor, 1202 C.E.
