   I want so much
   And at the same time nothing at all.
   No, strike that,
   It's like a negation,
   A want going in the opposite direction.
   Is this also wrong?
   A year... Soon.
   Yes, it's changing
   But in a wrong direction, too,
   Kind of growing.
   It was the right choice,
   I don't regret it,
   This time I actually remember myself making it.
   I knew there'll be a price,
   And I agreed.
   I'm not surprised
   Now that I'm paying it,
   And even the severity is as expected,
   Well, ok, maybe not that bit,
   Not the level of disrespect,
   But I agreed.
   I'm actually proud of it,
   Of that choice, of how it was made:
   Exactly the right way -
   With everything and come what may.
   So, no, I don't regret it.
   Only what to do if it keeps on growing?
   Any wise advise?
   My inner imaginary guide?
   Anyone?
