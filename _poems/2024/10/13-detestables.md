   So, I guess, you've given up, huh?
   And I've been blinding myself to this for a while...
   It's wiser for me to follow suit
   But I can't.
   Is this what my internal guide
   Is trying to teach me?
   That sometimes it's better to give up?
   To hell with the lesson then,
   It's too alien.
   I wish someone would explain
   Simple and plain
   The whole eventschain.
   I still don't know any facts.
   And I hate every single moron who thinks
   It's ok to just keep me in the dark:
   They'll come for all of you,
   Karmic hurricanes and typhoons.
   Because I'm not blaming myself, not this time,
   Honestly, I can't find
   A single wrong choice,
   A malicious intent.
   So, this time it's on you -
   Petty detestable not so few,
   Who wanted to use me so much
   For your petty detestable gains
   That you couldn't simply stay away.
   I wish you endless bad luck,
   Nothing will ever go your way,
   Not after what you did,
   You cynical fucks.
