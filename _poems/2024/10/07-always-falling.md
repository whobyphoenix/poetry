   We are always falling
   Down the gravity well,
   Which is a kind of flying.
   It's just not everyone feels it, apparently.
   Or perhaps they fail to notice
   Or refuse to recognize
   The sensation of weightlessness
   And directedness
   When your internal compass
   Points straight
   At the source of light.
