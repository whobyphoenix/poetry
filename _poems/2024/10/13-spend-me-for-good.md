   Ah...
   You've been trying to teach me
   The wretched Agape thing...
   How it really works, what it really means...
   There is no choice,
   So, Agape it is -
   You win.
   Though I object to your methods:
   How about
   You make acquaintance
   With a concept
   Of positive reinforcement?
   And why would you involve so many morons?
   They aren't gonna learn
   Whatever lessons you have for them.
   Obsessive learners don't happen that often...
   Could you please
   At least
   Rid me of this
   Ugly feeling of being a sticky mud on his shoes?
   It hurts on so many levels.
   Or better yet,
   Please invent
   A way to spend me for good.
   Currently
   I have this rare quality
   Of having nothing to lose,
   And when the wind is right
   I can tell a bird from a tool.
   Could still be useful.
   Don't let me just wither away
   In this pathetic whining
   With a pretense at rhyming,
   Must still be good for something.
   Between the two of us
   There must be enough creativity left.
   I can't just accept
   Survival for my fate.
   And yes,
   I still keep the promise,
   No other restrictions,
   Only please don't let me lie to myself:
   Nothing with a lie in it can be good,
   Nothing right can be based in a falsehood.
   At the heart of your light is the truth.
   The right choice is revealed by its pulse.
   So, let's stay truthful.
