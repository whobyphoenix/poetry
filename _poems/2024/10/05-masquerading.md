   It's nothing I did,
   I get it.
   Or what I am or could be;
   Nothing of my design or doing.
   A mere instrument -
   A wish granted
   (Is it this rare?)
   I know I ask the stupidest question ever:
   Why me? - "Why not?
   Is this not what you want?"
   It's nice of you to respond,
   I'm honored,
   Even if I don't act like it;
   I understand and don't regret
   A warm certainty of being guided.
   And yet,
   The explanations you never provided
   Make me seem so inadequate.
   "Understanding is not required."
   Yes, my dear Vorlon,
   You sculpture and mold
   And I'm never told
   The "why"-answers, only "what".
