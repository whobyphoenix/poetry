   Don't kill.
   Don't steal.
   Never lie.
   Never cry.
   Rules are about verbs,
   Setting up boundaries.
   As a child I thought
   this is what it takes:
   adopting the right rules,
   the true commandments.
   My first was "never cry",
   I remember exactly why.
   Then it turned out to be impossible to uphold
   for there are limits, so, early on
   I had this experience of updating my commandments.
   And I also remember how
   I formed (discovered?) my first value.
   We were debating death penalty.
   It was the time of anarchy
   and for a short while the state left schools alone,
   no indoctrination at all;
   teachers were free to shape the curriculum without ideological othersight.
   And we were debating death penalty in a history class.
   I was always lucky with my teachers.
   This one, she knew not to tell her opinion at all:
   she was only asking questions, moderating discussions.
   And I was very much 'pro',
   had all these logical arguments how it's just, "economical", and,
   considering a sorry state of Russian prisons, even humane.
   And then she asked this: "If there is death penalty
   then someone must actually do it:
   execute a person found guilty.
   Natasha, could you do it?".
   And immediately I knew the answer and how it makes my position invalid,
   I flipped 180°. Now I see
   that I was apparently failing Milgrem's experiment -
   that version when you are not the one pushing buttons,
   administering the punishment.
   And she with her question
   simplified the situation,
   turned it into the original version of the Milgrem's experiment.
   I don't think I would fail it even back then.
   Only I didn't see how it was the same:
   you are still a murderer even when there's a proxy,
   if you approve and pay salary to the executioner.
   This is how I discovered that I value human life.
   Because I absolutely cannot take it without self destruction.
   Rules are about verbs. Values are nouns.
   You discover your values by playing out trolley problems:
   what would you sacrifice for what, what takes precedence. 
   Your set of rules is a result of this process.
   It is to be reviewed and updated upon making a choice and facing consequences.
   The set is stable in a sense
   that any change to it is a major change in one's personality.
   What to do when you feel trapped by your values:
   give in and change?
   In me, it is defined with tiers:
   1st tier values are about other people
   as in sentient beings:
   your happiness, someone's life, someone's freedom.
   2nd tier values are about mental constructs,
   seemingly abstract yet important,
   like the truth or justice.
   3rd tier: self-improvement, my freedom, my life.
   4th tier: non-sentient beings, etc.
