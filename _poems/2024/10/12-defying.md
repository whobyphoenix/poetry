   I think I've found a new
   Way of defying You,
   My dear Vorlon.
   Seems illogical at first,
   But let's see if it works.
   You know by now
   I can't simply come along.
   This one may look like a compromise
   But I assure you, it's defiance.
   Oh, quit being so radiant.
   And if you think even for a second
   That this is me giving in,
   I swear I'll change my mind,
   I'm still the Master of it.
