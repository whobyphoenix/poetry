   Why do you make me feel things
   Again?
   It's no longer light.
   More like blazing pain.
   To keep it warm? Why???
   There's no possible use
   That I can devise.
   Why not let me stay
   In this comfortable numbness?
   Must every clay
   End up in a furnace?
   Do you ever have nightmares?
   Do thoughts
   Of suffering shapeless forms
   Ever haunt
   Your infinite dreams?
   The end does not justify the means.
