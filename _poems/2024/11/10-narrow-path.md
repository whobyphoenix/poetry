   The thing to understand is that all this time
   somewhere in the background of my mind
   there's this knowledge, acknowledgement
   of how close we all are to the watershed moment.
   How it's closer every day.
   How powerless I am to stop it.
   How all other considerations are minuscule in comparison.
   It's one thing to accept one's mortality,
   inevitability of one's death. It's quite another
   to see how narrow the path is
   for this not to be the end of everything I value.
   Легче верблюду пролезть сквозь игольное ушко,
   чем человечеству пережить Singularity.
   Looking at things from this perspective
   is both excruciating and liberating.
   Like living with a ticking bomb in your room.
   Sometimes I look away and pretend it's not there. But it is.
   I cannot make myself not see.
   It adds this time pressure to everything,
   a sense of utmost urgency.
   It's how right after the invasion
   and also after the Navalny's execution,
   for a while, everyone who understood
   what had just happened,
   they all had these eyes,
   like there were no more masks,
   no need for a mask,
   only the reality of the worst, the truth.
   The truth so important that petty squabbles,
   fears, routines were meaningless in its face.
   And how all the rest who refused to see it seemed crazy
   and like walking dolls, ignorant children,
   closing their eyes because
   if they can't see the boogeyman then it can't see them.
   It didn't last long and soon people were their usual selves 
   even amidst the flames
   burning our house.
   Only I have this handicap,
   a disability of sorts: I cannot make myself not see.
   There is no fear,
   not anymore. Actually I feel privileged
   that I'm here to live through it.
   I do want to see it all. Indeed,
   this is the greatest time in history.
   The grand finale or a very near miss against impossible odds.
   This perspective makes everything what's precious
   even more precious.
   Especially people.
   Especially their remaining time.
   It simply must
   be filled with as much love
   and happiness as possible.
