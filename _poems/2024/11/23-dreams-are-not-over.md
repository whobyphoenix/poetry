   Why be afraid of stars?
   They cannot fall.
   No way.
   Why fear the light?
   It won't burn your eyes.
   Don't fret. Just stay.
   Don't go away.
   And you're very right
   To fear the dust:
   How it covers us,
   Our mending hearts.
   That's why wind must blow,
   Blowing it away,
   Melting us with rain,
   Lighting up with rainbows,
   Lifting our hearts
   Up above the clouds,
   To that scary stars
   And their blazing light,
   In our final hours.

   In response to "I'm afraid of stars" by Nemra with Tankian.
