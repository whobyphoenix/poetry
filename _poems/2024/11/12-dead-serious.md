poem_title: "I'm dead serious."
authors: phoenix
books: strange-days-shards

   And this is how it was,
   For over a million years,
   Since the time of Homo erectus:
   For one, it's pure joy,
   For the other, death,
   With a chance like in Russian roulette.
   If I had been born a couple of centuries ago,
   By my age I'd be dead.
   Yeah, ok, scientific progress has helped,
   But you can't erase a million years in a hundred.
   And almost all of human culture reflects
   Only the perspective of the joyful one,
   Completely missing that for the other
   Each act of love
   Was a self-sacrifice.
