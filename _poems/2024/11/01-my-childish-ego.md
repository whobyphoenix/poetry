   I've figured out my mistake
   The lesson I'm unable to learn
   As is evident by all
   The whining and complaining.
   On some level
   Perhaps subconsciously
   There is this expectation -
   Childish and baseless -
   For it all to make sense.
   So, I'm acting hypocrite,
   Expecting gratification
   For doing the right thing.
   This is what's wrong.
   I'll try to be better from now on.
   I don't register this expectation
   While making a choice
   But it must be there
   On a deeper level;
   Twisting,
   Corrupting,
   Excruciating after the fact,
   Adding to the usual punishment.
   Must be my childish ego
   Crying from under the bench
   On that train station.
