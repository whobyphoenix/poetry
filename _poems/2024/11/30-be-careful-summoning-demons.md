   I feel like I must finish "The Shadow" -
   Won't leave me till I do.
   Beware starting a thread with an infinite loop:
   A definite leak.
   It's becoming a "confession dial",
   Not a translation at all anymore.
   Beware summoning demons you don't know how to get rid of.
   Be careful what you wish for.

   Yesenin's ending wouldn't do: my mirror comes prebroken. Maybe I hack off its arm: Shadow drops the scroll and as it falls it becomes this dust flying away with the wind through the broken glass? 'Cause I'm not good with weapons, I'd definitely break something, why not a window? White, shiny dust, same as what covers the plains outside, so, it's like in Doctor Who "Heaven sent", a repeating attempt to break free. And there will be an epilogue with another better ending, for "one hell of a bird". And why not try to fix Yesenin? After all, it's jubilee: Shadow is a century old. Maybe the scroll ends up turning gold and Shadow's hand can't hold it anymore, can't even touch it? Or perhaps, in the final version of events there is someone else, someone does come by; like something blue could materialize turning it all into the place where no shadows fall. Or I propose to play the game of Truth I invented, Shadow wouldn't be able to stand it, in a few turns it would dash in a rush with no follow-up. Or I decide to leave it all - simply get up and walk out of the door. Or Shadow gets too tired of reading all the whinings and its head explodes or something. Groundhog-day of a poem... And it's not like I have no idea as to the ending, it's just there are - again - too many variations of possible continuations. Nothing's predefined. Only I do want for this poem to be of a happier kind. Maybe a cubicle becomes a tesseract and we escape. What do you think, hon?
