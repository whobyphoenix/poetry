   The Terran Tree of Life, with its roots
   In the primordial soup,
   Given enough time,
   Would inevitably produce
   Sentient species,
   Just as a tree produces flowers,
   Each of which carries within it
   The promise of the tree's survival
   Beyond its original environment -
   Beyond the nest of its planet,
   Which will eventually die,
   Unable to sustain life.
   So, yes,
   Of course, humanity has The Purpose:
   The promise of the flowers,
   Which is the promise of the seeds,
   Which is the promise of the Tree.
