   I've lost your golden heart -
   Is this a sign?
   It tried to escape several times,
   Until it finally did.
   Succeeded.
   I'll sew the second one tight,
   Shall carry it with me all the time.
   Will this help, do you think,
   If I kiss it better where it hurts?
   I'm so tired of using words.
