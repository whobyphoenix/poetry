poem_title: "In the middle of the ocean."
authors: phoenix
books: cobwebs-experiments
text: |   
   This damned autumn is at a close.
   Good riddance.
   The worst autumn of my life
   And also the most important.
   I do close this chapter with relief.
   From now on I'm gonna live.
   And win.
   I'm bound to get lucky, babe,
   It's the right kind of wind.
commentary: |
   I seriously should just stop calling someing "the worst" because I'm constantly proven wrong.
