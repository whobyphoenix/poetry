   It's like an echo
   Climbing up the mountains,
   Off into the sky.
commentary: |
   "ura wo mise / omote wo misete / chiru momiji" by Ryōkan.
   An iterative self-interference...
   Since forever I had this vision
   in my mind for the same,
   only with a frictionless pool-table
   and a ball bouncing of chance occurrences:
   people, books, choices -
   every single one changing your trajectory;
   the greater the weight, the greater the change.
   Admittedly, 3D is cooler than 2D,
   and his vision has a better ending;
   however, for a ball
   to end up in the rabbit hole
   is much more natural...
   Although, his vision better captures
   how one is perceived
   by an outside observer: an interference
   of your present and all your pasts.
   What is echoed is changed with each reflection.
   Now what's the origin of the sound?
