  Word of words, the measure of all measures,
  Blessed be thy name, the name be blessed.
  Your freedom come, your will be done
  On Earth as in all Heavens.
  You give us daily bread,
  Forgive us our debts,
  As we forgive our debtors.
  You lead away from tempting thoughts,
  Deliver us from evil,
  And teach to see the light
  Where you reside,
  The one who's real.
