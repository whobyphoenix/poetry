  How about You do as you preach?
  What was it - "never cruelty "?
  Quite a joke coming from You.
  At least I had a decency not to multiply it.
  Yes, I've degraded to "whataboutism".
  Sorry, you're right, it's always a folly.
  Still, for someone who's teaching compassion
  You're sure as hell not big on it.
  Yes, sorry, self-inflicted, I remember.
  Is it though?
  Is it always so?
