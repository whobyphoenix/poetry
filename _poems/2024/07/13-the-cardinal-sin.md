It's captivating to observe
how good turns
into the evil it fights.
And the transformative moment,
the cardinal sin
seems to be allowing yourself any means.
"By any means necessary"...
One more proof how close
the realm of heroes is
to the realm of demons.
Every demon is a fallen hero...
With those who are making this choice right now, is it too late? 
Was I ever tested in this way? Have I failed?
