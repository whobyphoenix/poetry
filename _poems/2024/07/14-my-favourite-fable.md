It's about this teacher, 
Who's been preaching 
About good and evil, 
And how to live one's life the right way - 
Do what you must and come what may. 
And a pupil says: "I'm only human, 
Don't always know right from wrong, 
I will inevitably make a mistake, I will fall". 
"Get up", says the teacher. 
"Oh, but it doesn't solve it: 
Every consequent choice is a potential mistake - 
Just the same - 
It's a certainty that I will fall again". 
"Get up", says the teacher.

A teacher spills ink on a white sheet of paper
and asks pupils to describe what they see.
"Fireworks!", says one.
"A galaxy", says another.
"Ink spots?", says the smartest.
And the teacher drops the sheet of paper and begins to weep.
Troubled pupils ask: "Teacher! What's wrong?".
"Not one of you has noticed the white paper."
