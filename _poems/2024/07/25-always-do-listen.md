That thing 
We've heard from the wind
Today... Ridiculous, right?
Maybe not?
And then the small bird 
Said... That...
Well... You've heard.
It's either that, or we're completely mad.
Which is not only possible
But - let's face it - very likely,
To be expected actually,
Considering. The trouble
With not making assumptions 
Is that too many variations 
Of possible explanations
Are to be kept in one's mind
All the time.
Rather maddening, 
Don't you think?
Any more wise remarks?
Or shall we listen to the ducks?
