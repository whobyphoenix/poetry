The little boy lost,
He takes his laws
So seriously, 
Thinks just because 
He never broke the "Don't kill"
He's not a killer...
Hasn't faced 
Intense enough suffering, I say.
GULAG would've cured him right away
Of this presumption.
It specializes in this:
Making you renounce your beliefs,
Your ought-laws.
Granted, sometimes 
There are True-believers
But you can't study Him -
In Polar Wolf he is killed.
For being too good for this world.
For his stubbornness.
Don't watch the videos
You'll have nightmares.
Yes, there are others still alive.
The scariest thing I saw in my life
Was the eyes
Of a hero who learned the price
Of his convictions, his values.
He looked *only* at the skies
Paraded in front of us:
Hands behind his back in black cuffs,
Escorted by beasts and dogs.
The one on the cross
Must've also had these eyes:
Asking "Why?" and saying "No." at the same time,
Drinking in the blueness, too.
GULAG is a "catch-22".
Azkaban for heroes.
Inquisition made great again.
It must not exist. 
The torture must end.
