So :)
The six meanings
For the metaphor go
   like this:
For people it's a road to build,
A connection to use for beasts,
For demons it's something to burn,
A heavenly creature perceives
As a magnificent rainbow, 
A forever-hungry would jump of it,
The place where a hero would hold 
   the line,
The bridge to be crossed
   in time.
