I claim it's exactly zero, because
Let's for a minute suppose
It somehow happened.
Your brain is so predisposed
To treating it as impossible, that
Even if a miracle stares right at you,
It's to be overlooked and ignored:
You'd rather accept
Whatever perfectly reasonable rationalization
Pops in your head
Than the report of your own eyes,
And only later,
Maybe at night,
When you're no longer
In the mode of fight-or-flight
You'd allow yourself to wonder...
