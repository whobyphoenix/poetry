Ok...
It was the test...
And I failed...
Again...
Now that I've figured it out,
Does this count?
At least I know my mistake, 
I think I'm fixing it.
Am I?
Of course, not in time.
You should've known by now
Not to expect too much:
I'm kinda slow. 
Wherever the wind blows
I shall follow
Whatever the stakes.
Possession's impossible anyway.
