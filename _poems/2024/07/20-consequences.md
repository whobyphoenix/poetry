The truth points to itself.
And I am no longer afraid.
Tell me exactly how I failed.
"There's no time left to feel bereft",
Just like the Eels said.
And I confess,
I couldn't have faced
   it before.
Well,
   how about now?
List the casualties for me.
The truth will set us free,
Just like it always does.
What's so scary anyway?
My conscience can take the weight.
I'm tougher than I look, you know.
So, why do you belittle me
With your pity?
