  So...
  The metaphor of a rainbow...
  How would you assign the colours though?
  Violet is for the hottest, the hungriest...
  (Is this why lilacs are my favourite flowers?)
  Red is for creatures of Heaven -
  The colour of love and sun coming down.
  Blue is the ocean where heroes drown.
  Orange - for the demons' inferno.
  Or is it the other way around?
  Orange - for the sands
  Where heroes tread.
  And blue - for the merciless and cold
  Demons forever old.
  Green is for beasts,
  For reasons too obvious to list.
  People's color is gold,
  For to become Gold is their goal
  As any alchemist would know.
  And white
  Is the Light
  Creating the show.
