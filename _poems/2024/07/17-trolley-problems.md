   A little guide
   For the inquisitive mind 
   On solving real-life trolley problems.

   A solution to the trolley problem is well-known: choose the lesser of two evils. Yet, this "solution" is only acceptable in a mental exercise — a hypothetical trolley problem — and *never* in real life. For starters, it's immoral, obviously. But also, the trolley problem doesn't model reality well enough: it's only in the realm of hypotheticals that there are just two pathways; in reality possibilities are *endless*. Therefore, it's safe to assume that a better solution does exist; finding it is a matter of your ingenuity. But you can't find it if you aren't even looking, and you aren't looking if you've already given up and settled for the "lesser of two evils." So, the first and most important step is to refuse to give up and start looking.

   Secondly, since there is usually time pressure, it's generally a good idea to play for time, as solving this could be easier than solving the whole thing.

   Then, the best practice is, of course, to learn as much as possible, to the point where you can easily distinguish truth from lies. Perhaps you don't see the better way because you're missing an important piece of information or believe a lie. (For again, the better way does exist; if you don't see it, then something is wrong with your perspective, not with reality. What is it that you think you know, and how do you know it?)

   And if you still don't see the better way, then remember another important difference between the realm of hypotheticals and real life: there are no bounded systems in reality. Seemingly unrelated things still affect each other, and changes happen all the time (by the way, this is also why playing for time is generally a good idea).

   So, start changing things, meddle, change the equation. Even minor changes in the right direction might shake things up enough for a new pathway to appear where there was none. If not, repeat the step.

   And if, despite your best efforts, you find yourself giving up and finally settling for the lesser of two evils "solution," at least recognize it as a failure and try to learn lessons from it. Because again, the better way did exist, and it's on you that you couldn't find it.

   P.S. There are exotic cases when throwing your soon-to-be-dead body in front of a trolley in a final attempt to stop it becomes an option. And yes, this is still preferable to choosing evil. And I'm sorry that it is so.
commentary: |
   The best thing about sci-fi is that it's full of examples of trolley problems. I've just re-watched that "Arrow" episode where that man, what's his name, kills Shado - by the Arrow, with the Arrow as a murder weapon. "Стрела, ты кого выбираешь", спрашивает, и Стрела выбирает и убивает. Fucking monsters and their trolley problems... Of course, the Arrow's choice was on impulse and his reason was this banal biological fact that he knows that one longer: more neuron connections light up when it's about her, signifying higher importance. On the spur of the moment his mind forced him to make the obvious choice. Shortcuts. Human mind operates on those. But suppose, he had more time - he’d get to the same result. He observed how one of them degraded herself to a submission to the monster, becoming his instrument in torturing prisoners - that’s how much she wanted to survive. While another is of that culture where life doesn’t hold much value and the silly notion of honor is too well-rooted. So, the rational Arrow with eternity on his hands to make the right choice would’ve concluded the same, because his mind would model both of them, asked *them* the impossible question - “are you willing to sacrifice yourself?” - and got the obvious answers from them: "no" and "yes". Thus his choice.
   *The* solution to the trolley problem is actually this: to convince the ones you’ve already decided to sacrifice that it’s their own decision. Since only the noble ones would go for it then the right approach is to always sacrifice those with the “honor handicap” in their foolish minds: this is the only way to solve The Trolley Problem and keep a clear conscience.
   For the trick to work, of course, you must first train others to value honor; only make sure your own children stay free of this affliction. The notion of honor is this cultural mem that allows for a pool of sacrificial humans, raised for slaughter.
   Understanding it fully, perfectly, with excruciating clarity, I still choose not to change apparently. My codex is silly and a handicap, and I know it - thus it's all my fault.
   Never read them old books - your children - forbid them access to anything that might turn them into honorable freaks. Ensure that they are spoiled like you-know-who - he is the etalon of survivor. Him, and Putin, and Altman (in my opinion, allegedly).
   Rationally, yes, the goal of a parent is to max out the offspring’s chances of survival and procreation. Indeed, spoiling them, turning them into selfish brats is the best strategy; ensuring that no matter their age they are never in any doubt as to the fact that they are the center of the world and everything else is secondary: legacy, peace, humanity - everything be damned.
   My parents were the worst because I was perfectly aware - always - that both of them would sacrifice me not only for their own survival but also for stuff like their comfort. And yes, the silly books with silly notions like honor and “the code” helped me make peace with this. And yes, it pretty much makes my chances of survival and procreation zero.
   And that’s why truly smart parents have several children: one for sacrifice, one for passing on the genes, and maybe a few spares.
   Hmm. Once again you-know-who's father comes to mind as an example of a brilliant parent.
