  "Doesn't mean that laws
  Are no more.
  Only now you know
  Their true source,
  And who bears 
  The responsibility for it all. 
  In your subjective universe
  There is no one but you
  The law-maker, the judge,
  The executioner, too.
  Unless you step down
  From your throne, 
  Take off the crown
  And let someone else 
  Take your place.
  That's what love is for",
  Inscribed the wave on a blank shore.
