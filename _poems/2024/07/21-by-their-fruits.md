  I love that scene in "Peter Pan" 
  When they meet on Slippery Rock, 
     right at the top, 
  His enemy is at a disadvantage, 
  And the wonderful boy acts 
  As he always does - 
     with honor. 
  And yes, 
  He's instantly repaid 
  With unfairness, 
     as always.
  And I think 
  The most amazing thing about him 
  Is not that he can fly, 
  But that he still expects to find 
     the light 
  Where you see nothing, 
  Just a swarm of lies.
  And even after it's been proven many times 
  That Hook is a crickety crockety crook, 
  The hero is again surprised 
  By this dishonor.
