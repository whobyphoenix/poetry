  Doctor is the coolest: flies about -
  Traveling,
  Sight-seeing,
  Wherever his machine would bring him.
  It's usually to where he's most needed -
  Places with all the crying children.
  He always gets involved:
  Can't help himself really -
  Too much pain became empathy.
  And the best part is *how* he does it -
  Sorts things out -
  Mostly with just talking.
  Well... there's also lots of running,
  Meeting certain kind of companions.
  But I suspect
  It's only to keep him in shape.
  After all,
  He's about a thousand years old :)
  By the way,
  How long is a year on Gallifrey?..
  The episode with the Whale
  Explains it the best
  And also the one when they dance.
