My dear, oh so dear friend, 
I'm ill, oh so very ill.
This pain
Comes again.
A howling wind
Over a desolate field,
Or is it alcohol that blows away
My brain cells like leafs
Of September trees?
My ears wobble
On my noddle.
My head 
Can't stand
Standing on my neck
Tries to take
A flight.
Meanwhile,
A dark, oh so dark shadow,
A shade, oh so shady shadow,
On my bed he sits,
Doesn't let me sleep.
