  The level of absurdity 
  Makes it hard to suspend disbelief, 
  To take it at all seriously.
  The rational explanation goes like this.
  Lack of inspiration and hope, 
  Lack of vision for tomorrow 
  Leads to this sense of "closing time", 
  Leads to people quite rationally 
  Choosing aggressive strategies, 
  Leads to "closing time" and its sorrow. 
  Yet another vicious cycle to be broken 
  If we are to survive.
