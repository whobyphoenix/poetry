God is a poli!
That's why that angel has fallen.
Wasn't struck down or anything, 
Just couldn't take it:
Pity portrayed as mercy -
It's so insulting, so revolting.
Agape... Who'd settle for the agape thing,
If there's so much to be taken?
And to be given.
You should've tried it, you moron -
It's so enticing, so appealing.
You will've loved it, I'm certain.
