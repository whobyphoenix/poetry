Have I killed? No,
Not yet anyway. 
I generalize, 
Extrapolate from lesser crimes,
Venial sins.
Have I broken my laws?
Oh, yes...
Just enough times
To know full well
That following them is a choice.
Always.
Oh... 
Is this the true meaning
For the metaphor of the Apple of Eden?
You learn that the original sin,
The design flow built-in, 
Is that right and wrong don't really exist,
The only difference is 
What you make of it.
Upon learning this
The blissful paradise disappeares,
And you walk as an adult, 
In Freedom.

As to the first question, 
does ants count? 
Killed a few only today, 
inconvenient little buggers, 
always in a way...
