Land of the brave my ass...
"Power to the people"? 🤷 Never heard of it.
"Beacon of democracy"? 😱 What are you stupid?
😱 People are scary, it's chaos...
😇 Let's simply appease all dictators;
😉 'Cause we are not born equal:
😎 Rights are for humans born free.
"Dignity"? "Freedom"?
🤣 Oh, just accept that free you'll never be,
🤑 So, fuck it - let's just trade!
Your Founding Fathers keep spinning
In their graves, watching
How you betray
Their ideals.

what are you ranting about?
better give up, turn refugee;
we'll give you a loaf of bread,
a roof over your head,
and then you'll vote for us, right?
i mean left,
whatever;
and anyway, Ukrainians told us you're all genetic slaves;
it's such a convenient lie, isn't it?
and don't you dare to call it racist.
