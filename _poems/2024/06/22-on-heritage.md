My grandma was a witch: she claimed
She could see the future,
The truth in mirrors.
(Sometimes, time does rime,
Doesn't it, my dear?)
She saw a man's face,
And then, in a few of months
Saw the same
Looking at her from over the fence
Of course, married him right away
That's how I came into being.
When I was little, we performed
The ritual together
On that special winter night
Several times.
Saw nothing, until that year
When a shadow did appear.
I remember, I said
It was a shadow of a head
With horns (I know how this sounds...).
Well, it looked more like a crown.
Only I was bored,
Horns are cooler, I thought,
Scarier. Wanted to spook her.
Worked like a charm.
There were no more rituals for me
Since that one.
