authors: phoenix
books: unsinkable

   It's not that I'm high maintenance,
   Quite the opposite actually:
   You can forget of my existence
   And it wouldn't change a thing,
   Would be exactly within
   My expectations.
   It's when you don't,
   I'm helpless and lost,
   Don't know how to react.
   I understand
   It must look stupid and sad.
   I probably need lessons
   On happiness.
   Chose to keep it at a distance.
   I very much want to change it.
   It's all these well established patterns...
   There's honestly nothing I expect.
   Maybe a little respect.
   I see how all these bugs,
   Cockroaches in my head
   Must invoke disgust,
   Pity at best.
   I just want to be honest.
   It's in your best interests
   To stay away, I suspect,
   And I'm very serious
   About my promises.
   Whatever you think you like -
   It's just a facade,
   And on the inside
   It's this mess
   Of self-inflicted suffering
   And self-destructedness.
   I don't fear pain.
   I fear the moment
   When
   You'll notice all that.
   On another hand
   I'm like Cohen's garbage bags:
   Endless resilience,
   Master of nevergiveupence,
   Can't possibly mistreat
   When you finally tire of it.
   Though I'd very much like for you to try,
   And when the moment comes, I'll survive.
   I'm this honest because
   I don't remember that it ever was
   *This* severe.
   I know this honesty is self destructive, too,
   Only I don't want to lie, not to you.
