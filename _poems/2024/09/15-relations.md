   I don't trust her either...
   Believe her to be a coward and a liar,
   An apple fallen not too far from a tree.
   Blood is thinner than water.
   I've chosen my brother.
   I've chosen my sister.
   Like I've chosen a teacher.
   Like I've chosen a leader,
   The idea,
   The starlight to pursue.
   I generally prefer
   For the things to happen to me by choice
   With a few exceptions like my cat:
   She just happened to me.
   All-in-all, I don't have a family
   Beyond people I choose it to be.
   Those raised in happier homes
   Probably can't understand it.
   Well, your experience
   Is incomplete.
