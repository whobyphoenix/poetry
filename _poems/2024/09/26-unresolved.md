   If you wonder as to the reasons,
   There are none:
   I'm not making assumptions,
   Not even on what you are.
   There is this recognition,
   Like a premonition.
   The irresistible drive,
   Desire to solve the riddle.
   But I'm very careful
   Not to make up stories,
   Preemptive guesses.
   Not to spoil the discovery.
   Maybe it's the perfectionist in me
   Can't let it be,
   Lay off, set the riddle free,
   Let it go unresolved.
