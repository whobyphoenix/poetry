   It goes like this:
   A planet gets too cold,
   Its atmosphere too thin.
   Cannot support
   Liquid water anymore.
   So much of it
   Is lost to space:
   All the oceans, even lakes.
   What's left is frozen,
   Incorporated into dust,
   Mineralized.
   And only ripples tell the story
   Of the past glory.
