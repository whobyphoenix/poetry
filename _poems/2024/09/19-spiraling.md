poem_title: "The Rings of Power."
authors: phoenix
books: unsinkable
text: |
   One mistake leads to another,
   One wrong choice necessitates the next
   Making it harder and harder
   To turn around, to go back.
   I watch Celebrimbor
   Drowning in a cesspool of lies,
   Prince Durin giving in,
   And what comes to mind
   Is that dream
   Of yet another staircase
   Spiraling down:
   Oh, how quickly I turned around,
   How hurried in horror
   Back to the top and out.
