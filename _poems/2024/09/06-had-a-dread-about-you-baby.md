poem_title: "Today's dream..."
authors: phoenix
books: unsinkable

   Didn't take that much...
   It was only a touch...
   Well, a kiss and a touch...
   A light tender touch...
   Not sure, if the scream
   Was only in the dream...
   Not sure, what were to happen next,
   The pleasure was too intense.
