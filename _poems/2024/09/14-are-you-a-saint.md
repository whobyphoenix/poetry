   Why are Gallifreyans double-hearted?..
   And what happens when they give them both away?
   How do they keep walking around?
   So many questions only my mind has walked out on me.
   And maybe it's a good thing:
   after all, it is so keen
   on finding interesting ways to misinterpret things.
   So, instead of waiting for it to come back, I'll rely on the feedback.
   Seems like a promise to keep...
   That snail, the queen of Fudzi,
   Should be giving me pointers.
