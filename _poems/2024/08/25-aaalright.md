  Naaah, changed my mind:
  It's gonna be aaalright.
  Survival is a choice,
  So, let's choose right.
  Consider all the realities
  Branching forward.
  It only looks bleak when you focus
  On the paths abruptly stopped.
  Amongst this multitude
  There must be at least one route,
  One way out.
  And you only need the one, don't you?
