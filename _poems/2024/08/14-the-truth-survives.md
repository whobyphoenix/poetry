  All the truth survives
  While mortals weave the patterns
  On the cloth of lies.
commentary: |
  "For truth is eternal and divine and no phase of it can pass without a trace; it remains in existence even if the cloth in which weak mortals dress it disintegrates into dust." - Hermann Grassmann, a linguist and a scholar of sanskrit, the father of modern linear algebra.
