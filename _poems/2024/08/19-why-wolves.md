  The part I hate the most
  Is this obsessive guessing.
  Last time it happened
  It took me about a decade.
  Because how?
  How does one self-improve
  If "garbage in, garbage out" is true?
  Good data is essential for learning.
  For self-fixing.
  And all the versions now
  Include the "i've been used" part.
  Only not sure by how many.
  And the worst thing, of course,
  Is the inability to learn the truth.
  They'll eat me up, my why-wolves.
