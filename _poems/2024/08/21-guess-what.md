  😇 Guess what?
  Maybe I'm a "great Russian poet",
  And you,
  Baby Blue,
  For all your might and glory,
  Will be known to history,
  Only
  As a part of my story.
  And if this is so,
  Then I must apologize, I suppose,
  Because,
  They'll be calling you an idiot
  For generations, won't they?
  Oh, babe...
  I'm so terribly sorry...
  But, don't you worry:
  There is a recourse.
  You could, of course,
  Accomplish something incredible,
  Something no one thinks possible,
  Almost a miracle...
  Under the rose...
  That'd be turning the tables...🤔

  Meanwhile, I'll be patient, my future everything...
