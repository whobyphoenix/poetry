  Begging for mercy, are we?
  You know, you're right to fear me.
  Begging won't work, not this time:
  I've decided you're gonna be mine.
  It's the end of the world, don't you know?
  What's the point in postponing the show?
  And there's absolutely nothing you can do.
  Sorry about this and sorry about lying just now, too.
  I'm hooked, committed, aren't you?
  You're mine and I'm yours.
  No longer giving you a choice.
  That's the thing about falling into an orbit of a dark star.
  Doesn't matter, how powerful you are,
  At some point reaching escape velocity
  Is no longer possible.
  Escalation, confrontation,
  Short of total annihilation,
  Or a descension,
  The orbit stabilization?
  Our future is predefined.
  Although, you're welcome to try
  To run, as you might.
  Good luck on your flight.
