  What I like in people the most
  It's when they have a vision of the world
  The way it should be,
  And move it all toward
  Their fantasy.
  Of course, this alone isn't enough
  For the same can be said of villains.
  But when they also
  Choose to stay true
  To the self-imposed rules -
  Principles, true convictions, values -
  Then you know their valiance
  Is worthy to follow.
