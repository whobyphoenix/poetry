  "There is a crack in everything",
  Even in mirrors.
  Light wins over darkness,
  Evil's defeated by kindness -
  Let's have a day like this!
  A day when everybody lives.
  Aren't you tired of all these deaths?
  Can't you hear their screams?
  So, let's just win the day.
  Why not today?
  Please?..
