  Yes,
  I believe that you're thus,
  when the heart is hassled by a pulse
  of hate like blood lust.
  Lower the urge to grow up!
  It derives
  from the major highways
  of the brain,
  where I've gained
  such a mass
  surge of class
  creation of danger
  that my mind escapes
  through the looking-glass.
