  Do I cause more harm than good,
  Or is it the other way around?
  Yes, "у-вей" is the right way,
  And I mostly just follow the sound.
  Not always.
  Keep rushing, making mistakes.
  Only these days
  I'm punished right away,
  Almost without delay.
  I take it as a good sign:
  The Moon must be close by...
