poem_title: "The Blaze Star."
authors: phoenix
books: weird-fishes

  So, maybe,
  It's not an ascension or a fall
  But a dance
  To be repeated over centuries -
  A cycle that culminates
  In a recurrent nova?
  When a white dwarf seemingly dead
  Suddenly gets
  Enough hydrogen
  From this ancient red giant
  It keeps dancing around,
  It explodes,
  Shining brighter than a real star.
  At least for a while.

  And experts agree
  there are no guarantees, 
  I guess, we shall see.
