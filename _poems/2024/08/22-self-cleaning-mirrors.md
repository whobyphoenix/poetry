  Maybe some of it IS for me.
  Maybe it's a folly
    to give them all away.
  You keep granting me favors.
  Maybe you're smiling
    and think me a little ungrateful.
  Like I'm exchanging gifts
  Meant for keeping.
  You love when mirrors are self-cleaning?
  It seems,
  I'm one of your favourites
    lately:
  You take me places.
  And I thank you.
