  While the "Heaven Sent"
  Is the most profound,
  The one with the fireplace
  Is beautiful and sad all around.
  It's seven years of bad luck,
  Says every clock,
  When a mirror breaks,
  Whatever the reasons
  Or the stakes.
  Unless she keeps
  Shards and bits
  Of her childish dreams
  And rebuilds
  The fireplace
  In Versailles.
  Then Who does escape?
  And Who's left to sigh?

  The best one is about Vincent, always makes me laugh and cry.
