  All the petals of my mind
  Are driving me insane,
  Splitting me apart...
  I'm too empty,
    too easy to possess these days.
  I thought, I've chosen right,
  But the light is sipping away.
  Or maybe,
    this is how it's supposed to be:
  Not sipping away but shining.
  I carry my thoughts with me
    like autumn leaves.
  So, what is
    the color of the wind?

  I was given a blue khata today...
  You find the most peculiar ways
  To answer my inquiries,
  Dear Universe...
