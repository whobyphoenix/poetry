  All the petals of my mind
  Are driving me insane,
  Splitting me apart...
  I'm too empty,
    too easy to possess these days.
  I thought I've chosen right,
  But the light is sipping away.
  Or maybe
    that's how it's supposed to be:
  Not sipping away, but shining?
  I carry my thoughts with me,
    like the wind carries autumn leaves.
  So what color is the wind?

  I was given a blue khata today...
  You find the most peculiar ways
  To answer inquiries,
  My dear Universe...
