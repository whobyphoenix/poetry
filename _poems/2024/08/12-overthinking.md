  I'm on the brink of this realization
  that I'm overthinking it probably,
  assigning too low probability
  on the least complex explanation.
  Just because I'm too wary
  of the wishful thinking,
  as one should be.
  Trying not to believe in the good stuff
  until it's a fact
  so irrefutable that
  there can be no foul play to suspect,
  no alternative explanation to invent.
  Only for an inventive mind,
  imagination so wild,
  it's hard to run out
  of reasons for a doubt.
  I suppose it's a hypothesis to test
  and, if true, to autocorrect.
