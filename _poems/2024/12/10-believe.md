   Sometimes I act as if
   I believe -
   But "just in case".
   And it's the worst kind of faith
   Isn't it?
   A mockery.
   Insincerity is a sin.
   You point to my own words
   That are now empty.
   "Come what may" means
   Not considering their motives,
   Or how likely it is
   That they want to use me,
   That he only pities me,
   Or that it's his vanity.
   Now I suspect them all
   Of having in them beastly bits:
   Falsehood, selfishness, cowardice.
   I should unlearn this lesson.
   It's so easy to believe
   in the dead:
   They cannot change or betray,
   They also cannot change for better.
   I still believe the one I call my teacher,
   That he of all people
   would mean well.
   He is like a spiritual father to me, isn't he?
   I trust him implicitly.
   Even when I think him mistaken,
   I still know he has good intentions.
   It's like with my anda, my chosen brother.
   The goodness of his heart I'd never doubt.
   And the man I love is asymptotically perfect,
   I never doubt it.
