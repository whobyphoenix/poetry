   I decide to take it as a good omen,
   And NOT as a consolation prize
   From you, my dear Universe:
   The fact that you
   Are so damn beautiful today.
   I take it as a sign
   That you're on my side,
   And come what may.
commentary: |
   Now that I know that 2025 is the worst year of my life - so far - it does seem like I should've been more grateful for the attempt at consolation.
