   Perhaps, you worry,
   That I might just win?
   What'll I do? Who will I be?
   You're also used to losing, aren't you?
   Maybe it's a bad habit
   And we should both drop it?
   Remember that vision
   Of the day when everybody lives,
   How is it not appealing?
   Maybe you let the evil win
   Too often?
