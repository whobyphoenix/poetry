   I don't like the name "sundogs",
   nor do I like that it's supposed to be a bad omen,
   who needs omens for weather anyway nowadays?
   "Light pillars" is indeed better.
   And I personally prefer to think of it
   as a non-Euclidean rainbow:
   with infinite radius thus observed
   as two parallel lines instead of an arc.
   I take it as the Universe trying to cheer me up:
   sending me rainbows and a white hare.
   Much appreciated. I even like that
   it's a little too silly: rainbows in December
   and a white rabbit in the middle of a capital.
   Well, maybe I am a little crazy,
   so what, at least I'm definitely not average,
   as in grey, boring, and normal.

   What I still don't get at all is who wants what. Sometimes, to learn the way to go you just learn what monsters want of you and do the opposite. Everything is so inconsistent. And here in Astana I feel so well protected, it's nice to feel safe.
