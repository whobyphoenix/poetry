   It doesn't matter anymore anyway.
   It's just if people don't admit to their mistakes,
   How are they to learn?
   I believe they could've won.
   And the reason they lost
   Is that mistake in summer twenty twenty two.
   Whoever made it, for whatever reasons -
   It was a mistake - the mistake - to take the course
   To blaming all Russians, not the regime, waging the war
   against the nation instead of its oppressors.
   Putin ≠ Russia.
   Navalny is right.
   Pity no one will ever admit it.
