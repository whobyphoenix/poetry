   Ok, I admit that this is also an obsession
   which is probably unhealthy.
   Only is it that bad, must I fight it?
   Under different circumstances
   it would've been a good thing, great even.
   It's a catch-22:
   to take my mind of you
   I need to concentrate on something else
   but I find it almost impossible to concentrate.
   I need to find something else to do,
   simple and meditative like cooking.
   There's still this aversion to coding
   even though I'm pretty sure I'm still good at it.
   It's just it's never finite,
   never a moment you can be finally done
   with a software project.
   Code does rot. And it's so frustrating.
   "Never create anything or it will haunt you".
   Same with people, when you let them too close,
   they become like software you must keep on tending.
   I like talking to strangers.
   It's a pity in Russia there's nothing similar to pub-culture.
   Like in the Netherlands with life jazz and ale.
   And all the strangers talking over each other, yet,
   never disrespectfully, no stupid advances,
   no impoliteness - at least in my experience.
   And they don't do a silly chitchat -
   I'm so not good at it -
   they'd discuss something interesting
   like space or poetry.
   And there's never enough space
   so you're kind of forced to communicate.
   I miss that. It's strange
   that it's not popular everywhere:
   surely there are plenty of small pubs
   that could benefit from a performance
   and local musicians in a need of a place to jam.
   But I digress. A distraction...
   I am in a search for meditative activity
   with short time frame
   and easily evaluated results.
   That's what composing what I call poems actually is.
   Only I'm lately going overboard
   with sadness and/or madness.
   I don't have enough concentration for reading.
   Long walks with audiobooks is a good option.
   It's just this phase, when you're constantly on my mind,
   it's supposed to be the best, you are so missing out.
