   The dream, it was about staircase, too.
   Only this time it was it this grand,
   very official looking building
   (at least from the inside).
   I was heading upstairs,
   I knew exactly who I'd find there.
   Only I suddenly realized
   (you know how it happens in dreams sometimes)
   that I'm half naked.
   Not terribly indecent, just very out of place
   on that marble staircase.
   And there were these two women,
   and they kind of started leading me.
   Leading me down. Not really,
   they were not even talking to me,
   not acknowledging my existence.
   But I was following them -
   down the stairs.
   And it was getting darker and darker.
   And at some point
   it was like all lights went out.
   And I was blindly searching
   for switches on the wall,
   buttons, leavers,
   anything to switch on.
   And something must've worked,
   there was this one dim orangy light bulb.
   And that's when I realized -
   sensed - that you're right behind me.
   And then it was like in the September poem.
