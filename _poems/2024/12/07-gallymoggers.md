authors: phoenix
books: cobwebs-experiments
text: |   
   Kiotchyn, Saganistute, zounder.
   Your moves are making me wonder
   If we are gallymoggers
   Or just naught for usal.
   Let's go yadder,
   Go stang or orgal,
   Noge or ezel,
   To Witzend or Queast.
   Not even fairfarren
   To slurvish shukrns and frumious beasts.
commentary: |
   Down with the bloody red queen!
